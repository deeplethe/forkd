# Join this machine to a sandstorm master as a node.
#
# Served by the master at GET /install.sh with the two placeholders below
# filled in, so the copy you run already knows where it came from. The console
# (and `POST /v1/node-bootstrap`) hands out the one line that fetches it.
#
# What it does: decide the backend and check this machine can run it, fetch
# the master's own binary so the versions cannot drift, install it, write a
# node unit, start it. The node dials out, so this machine needs no inbound
# port.
#
# The backend (SANDSTORM_BACKEND):
#
#   gvisor       runsc, which runs on any Linux machine. The default.
#   firecracker  microVMs. Needs /dev/kvm, a guest kernel (SANDSTORM_FC_KERNEL,
#                an uncompressed vmlinux; scripts/install-guest-kernel.sh
#                fetches one), and a work dir (SANDSTORM_STATE_DIR) on XFS
#                with reflink=1 or on btrfs. The firecracker binary is taken
#                from SANDSTORM_FIRECRACKER or the PATH, or else the pinned
#                release is downloaded and its sha256 checked.
#   auto         firecracker where this machine has /dev/kvm, gvisor where it
#                has not. It says which it picked, and why.
#
# Every requirement is checked before anything is installed, and then once
# more by the node's own binary (`sandstormd preflight`), which makes the
# very checks the node makes when it starts. A machine that cannot run the
# backend is refused, saying what is missing; nothing is left half-installed.
#
# The choice is written to $SANDSTORM_STATE_DIR/backend rather than into the
# unit, so the console can later move an empty node to the other backend:
# the node rewrites that file and restarts (crates/sandstorm-core/src/node/
# switch.rs).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# On trust, because this runs as root and the honest answer is not "it is
# fine".
#
# The master's certificate is signed by its own CA, so plain curl refuses it
# and the one-liner cannot simply verify. What the registration token carries
# is the CA's SHA-256 (`<fingerprint>.<secret>`), and this script uses it:
# it fetches the CA, checks the fingerprint, and does every later request
# with --cacert. So the binary and the join are verified.
#
# The gap is this script itself. The first fetch cannot be verified by a
# fingerprint the script has not read yet, so a machine-in-the-middle could
# substitute THIS FILE and skip the checks below. Two ways to close it:
#
#   SANDSTORM_CA=/path/to/ca.pem   copy the master's pki/ca.pem over first and
#                              point curl at it from the start, or
#   verify by hand             fetch with --cacert and inspect before piping
#                              to a shell.
#
# Piping an unverified script to root is a real exposure on an untrusted
# network. It is the same shape as every `curl | sh` installer, except that
# here the token at least makes everything after the first hop verifiable.
