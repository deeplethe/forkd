# Everything the installer reaches outside this machine is stubbed: curl
# serves the CA and a stand-in sandstormd from a directory, openssl hashes to
# the token's pin, systemctl does nothing, and id says root. KVM is a
# character device the test picks (/dev/null for "there is one"), and
# `cp --reflink=always` succeeds or fails as the case asks, so each refusal
# can be reached on any Linux machine. What is checked is what an operator
# would see: which backend it took, what it refused and why, and that a
# refusal leaves nothing installed.
