//! Desired state, on disk, in sqlite.
//!
//! Two rules this module exists to enforce, both learned the hard way in
//! the v0.5 controller:
//!
//! 1. **The DB holds what we WANT, never what we observed.** Actual state
//!    is read back from the node every time. A controller that trusts its
//!    own cache kills sandboxes it merely forgot about.
//! 2. **A restart adopts, it never reconciles by killing.** Measured on bm:
//!    `kill -9` on the controller cost 0 of 20 sandboxes, and all 20 were
//!    re-adopted in 134 ms, because each sandbox lives in its own systemd
//!    scope rather than as our child.
