//! The engine underneath a node: the few operations that differ between
//! gVisor and anything else that could run a sandbox.
//!
//! A backend prepares a sandbox's writable layer and its bundle directory
//! from a template -- an overlay and an OCI spec for runsc, a reflinked disk
//! image and a VM description for Firecracker -- and is then asked to start,
//! checkpoint, restore or remove the sandbox from them. Everything else
//! `Runtime` does is the node's own and stays there: the network namespace,
//! tags, archives, and every tier change that is a cgroup write.
//!
//! `bundles/<id>/config.json` existing is what "this sandbox is on this
//! node" means to `Runtime`, whatever the backend writes in it.
//!
//! What `Runtime` relies on, and a backend must therefore keep true:
//!
//!   - Every process of a sandbox lives in the cgroup the bundle names
//!     (`linux.cgroupsPath`, `/sys/fs/cgroup/sandstorm/<id>`). Frozen is a
//!     write to that cgroup's `cgroup.freeze`, `observe` reads its
//!     `cgroup.procs`, density reads `memory.current`, and `destroy` falls
//!     back to `cgroup.kill`. A backend that started anything outside it
//!     would leave that thing running through a freeze and a destroy.
//!   - A started sandbox does not belong to this process. A node restart
//!     must find it still running and adopt it from the bundle directory.
//!   - Nothing here blocks unbounded. Each call has its own deadline, so a
//!     wedged engine fails one sandbox instead of stopping the node's loop.
