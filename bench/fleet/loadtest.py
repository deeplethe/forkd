"""Fleet load test for a v0.6 master.

What this is for
----------------

`bench/` already measures one host: `bench-spawn-100.sh` spawns 100
sandboxes through the old single-host CLI, and the `pause-window` and
`chain-spawn` probes drive the HTTP API one sandbox at a time. Neither
shape answers the questions a fleet raises -- how creates distribute
across nodes, where the master starts refusing, and whether the thing
in the way is a node or the master's own lock.

So this drives the **master API** (so it measures what a caller
actually experiences), **concurrently** (so queueing shows up), across
**however many nodes are registered** (so placement shows up), and it
reads `/metrics` either side of the run so the control plane's own view
sits next to the client's.

Three things to know before reading a number out of it
------------------------------------------------------

1. **A sandbox falls to `frozen` after 30 s idle** by default
   (`--idle-frozen-secs`). A run that creates a few hundred and then
   measures them is measuring restores, not steady state. `--touch`
   keeps them hot during the hold; without it the report says how many
   drifted so the number is not read as something else.

2. **Admission is up to `--hold-secs` stale and nothing is reserved.**
   A node reports free memory on its poll; a burst of creates arriving
   inside one hold window all see the same figure and all land on the
   same node. That overshoot is a real property of the scheduler, and
   at high `--concurrency` it is probably what you are measuring.

3. **A capacity refusal is a 503.** It means the fleet is full, not
   that the master is broken. The ramp stops there by default, because
   that is the capacity answer; `--through-refusals` keeps going.

Nothing here is destructive to a node: it creates sandboxes through the
API and deletes them again, and it will not start if the fleet already
holds sandboxes it did not make (`--allow-existing` overrides).
