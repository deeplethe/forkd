/**
 * A `fetch` that verifies `https://` against the PEM bundle at `caFile`
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * Node's global fetch has no option for this. Its `dispatcher` wants an
 * Agent from the `undici` package, a dependency this SDK does not otherwise
 * have, and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` is read once at startup and adds to the
 * public roots rather than replacing them. `node:https` takes `ca` directly,
 * and replacing is what we want: the master's CA is the only issuer that
 * should be able to sign for it.
 *
 * Only the part of fetch `Controller` uses. Imported lazily so that the
 * SDK still loads where there is no `node:https`, which is also why a bad
 * `caFile` surfaces on the first request rather than in the constructor.
